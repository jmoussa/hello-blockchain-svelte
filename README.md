# Hello World, but make it Blockchain... and in Svelte(kit)

**NOTE: This branch `sveltekit` is the Sveltekit implementation that includes a router and header component out of the box.**

A simple "hello world" application that will allow you to change the "world" via a smart contract deployed on the blockchain.
It costs you ETH gas but it's mostly for educational purposes in illustrating what a simple template of a svelte+solidity application would look like.

**The MOST convoluted Hello World Application I've built. Java has nothing on this.**
